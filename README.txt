INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------
    This project is intended to be a personal interactive resume. The general structure follows the traditional resume, where each section contains separate but related information. This differs from a traditional resume, however, in that it adds a personal dimension. With colors and animation, personality can be conveyed more easily. This project can be viewed best on Chrome browser.


EXTERNAL LIBRARIES AND SOURCES
-----------------------------
    1. jQuery.js
    2. zoomooz.js
    3. Bootstrap framework
    4. www.cssbakery.com: templates for visualizing data
    5. www.css-tricks.com: CSS transform and transition functions


FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------------
Future iterations should include a responsive design for smaller screens (i.e. mobile) and optimization for alternative browsers (Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.). Alternatives for the zoomooz.js library should also be explored as functionality is more limited when combined with the Bootstrap grid system.
